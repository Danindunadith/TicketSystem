# Ticket Reply Functionality

## Overview
This implementation allows users to submit replies to tickets and view all replies in a dedicated page. The data is persisted using React Context and localStorage.

## How It Works

### 1. ReplyTicket.jsx
- **Purpose**: Form to submit replies to tickets
- **Features**:
  - Displays original ticket information
  - Form fields: Topic, Reply Message, Status
  - Validates form data before submission
  - Saves reply data to context
  - Redirects to UserTicketReplies page after successful submission

### 2. UserTicketReplies.jsx
- **Purpose**: Displays all submitted ticket replies
- **Features**:
  - Shows statistics (Resolved, In Progress, Pending)
  - Lists all replies with original messages and admin responses
  - Allows deletion of replies
  - Displays timestamps and status indicators
  - Empty state when no replies exist

### 3. TicketReplyContext.jsx
- **Purpose**: Manages ticket reply data across components
- **Features**:
  - Stores replies in localStorage for persistence
  - Provides functions to add, update, and delete replies
  - Automatically loads saved data on app startup

## Usage Flow

1. **Navigate to a ticket**: Go to `/oneticket/:id` to view ticket details
2. **Click "Reply to ticket"**: This navigates to `/admin/tickets/reply` with ticket data
3. **Fill the form**: Enter topic, reply message, and select status
4. **Submit**: Click "Send Reply" to save the data
5. **View replies**: Automatically redirected to `/replies` to see all replies

## Data Structure

Each reply contains:
```javascript
{
  id: "TKT-{timestamp}",
  topic: "Ticket subject",
  originalMessage: "Original ticket message",
  status: "pending|in-process|finished",
  createdAt: "ISO date string",
  updatedAt: "ISO date string",
  adminReply: "Admin's reply message",
  adminName: "Support Team",
  replyDate: "ISO date string"
}
```

## Routes

- `/admin/tickets/reply` - Reply form page
- `/replies` - View all replies page
- `/oneticket/:id` - Individual ticket view (has "Reply to ticket" button)

## Features

- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Data persistence (localStorage)
- ✅ Real-time statistics
- ✅ Delete functionality
- ✅ Responsive design

## Testing

2. Navigate to a ticket page
3. Click "Reply to ticket"
4. Fill out the form and submit
5. Verify the reply appears in the UserTicketReplies page
6. Test the delete functionality
7. Refresh the page to verify data persistence
